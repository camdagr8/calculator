# Some Things to Try

## Keyboard Only

## Mouse Only
Use only the mouse to input values.

## Change the Operator
Change the operator by clicking the `+` key or the `+/-` key.

## Backspace from Keypad
Use the keypad's backspace button to remove a number from the active input.

## Clear the Input
Use the keypad's clear button to remove all values from the input.

## Change the Operators
In the `~/src/app/components/Calculator/index.js` file, change the `Calculator.defaultProps.operators` values to addition and multiplication.
